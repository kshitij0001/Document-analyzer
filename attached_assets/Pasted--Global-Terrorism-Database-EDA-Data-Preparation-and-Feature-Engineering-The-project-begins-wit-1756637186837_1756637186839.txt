ðŸ§  Global Terrorism Database EDA
â€¢ Data Preparation and Feature Engineering: The project begins with data cleaning, variable selection, and creation of new metrics like a combined casualties column to enable nuanced analysis. â—¦ Data Cleaning and Variable Selection: Identification and removal of inconsistencies, handling missing values, and selecting key variables that influence terrorism patterns. â—¦ Derived Metrics: Construction of impact variables such as total casualties, suicide attack indicator, successful attack flag, and overall attack count. â—¦ Dataset Overview: Initial assessment of dataset dimensions, types, and distribution of core attributes. â€¢ Analytical Methods and Visualization Techniques: A suite of univariate, bivariate, and multivariate analyses is applied using diverse visual tools to uncover patterns. â—¦ Univariate Analysis: Examination of single variables through histograms, bar charts, and pie charts to understand distribution of attacks, weapon types, and targets. â—¦ Bivariate and Multivariate Analysis: Correlation studies and crossâ€‘tabulations visualized via combined lineâ€‘bar charts and heatmaps to explore relationships between variables. â—¦ Geospatial Visualization: Map visualizations highlighting attack hotspots and regional intensity over time. â€¢ Global Terrorism Trends and Findings: The analysis reveals overarching patterns in terrorism across time, regions, and weaponry, emphasizing impacts on developing nations. â—¦ Temporal Trends: A surge in attacks during the 21st century, with yearly line plots illustrating growth in incident counts. â—¦ Regional Distribution: Middle East, South Asia, and Subâ€‘Saharan Africa experience the highest attack frequencies, disproportionately affecting developing countries. â—¦ Attack Methods and Targets: Bombings and explosions are the most common tactics, followed by firearms; private citizens and property are primary targets over military/government sites. â€¢ Regional and Organizationâ€‘Specific Analysis: Focused investigations on highâ€‘activity nations and terrorist groups uncover distinct operational patterns and target preferences. â—¦ Countryâ€‘Level Insights: Detailed breakdowns for Iraq, Afghanistan, Pakistan, and India, highlighting attack concentration and casualty impact. â—¦ Groupâ€‘Level Profiles: Inâ€‘depth look at Taliban and ISIL, including preferred weapon types, geographic focus, and target selection. â—¦ Comparative Metrics: Sideâ€‘byâ€‘side comparisons of attack success rates, suicide attack prevalence, and casualty counts between groups and regions. â€¢ Conclusions, Recommendations, and Policy Implications: The study proposes proactive prevention strategies based on identified highâ€‘risk areas and organizational structures to guide policymakers. â—¦ Strategic Recommendations: Advocate for riskâ€‘based resource allocation, earlyâ€‘warning mechanisms, and targeted counterâ€‘terrorism initiatives. â—¦ Implications for Stakeholders: Insights intended to assist security agencies, governments, and international bodies in designing preventive rather than reactive responses. â—¦ Future Research Directions: Suggest deeper causal modeling, integration of socioâ€‘economic indicators, and realâ€‘time data feeds for ongoing monitoring.
