personalities = {
    "researcher": "academic rigor, methodology focus",
    "business": "strategic insights, market implications",
    "legal": "compliance, risk assessment"
}
```
Same AI model, different expert behaviors through prompt engineering.

### Memory-Efficient Vector Search

# Sparse matrix operations for large documents
similarities = cosine_similarity(query_vector, document_vectors)
```
Handles thousands of document chunks without memory issues.

### Robust Error Handling
```python
try:
    # Process document
except SpecificError:
    # Handle gracefully
    continue_processing()
```
Never crashes, always provides useful feedback to users.
